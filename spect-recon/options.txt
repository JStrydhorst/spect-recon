Usage:
    spect_recon [working-dir] options

The following options are hardcoded for the moment
Projection input file:          [working-dir]/SPECT.dcm
Scatter input file:             [xorking-dir]/scatter.dcm
Normalizion file directory:     [working-dir]/norms/      [must exist before running the reconstruction]
Attenuation map directory:      [working-dir]/atten/      [must exist before creating the cumulative attenuations maps]
Output directory:               [working-dir]/recons/     [must exist before running the reconstruction]


-A attenuation_map      creates the cumulative attenuation maps from the specified attenuation map (does not do reconstruction)

-a scale_factor         enables attenuation correction (doesn't currently check for the presense of attenuation maps), optional [scale_factor reduces the attenuation]

-b beta_s delta         sets the strenth of the MAP prior (beta) and the delta parameter (see Geman and McClure)

-c                      save the current reconstruction after each sub-iteration

-f filter_fwhm          filter after each iteration with a Gaussian with the specified FWHM (in mm)

-g beta_t               sets the strength of the temporal prior

-h halflife             specify the halflife of the isotope (in minutes)

-l limit                trims the values of the reconstruction to the specified limit

-m sysmat_dir           uses a projection matrix other than the default

-low_res                sets the reconstruction resolution to 1.0 mm instead of the default of 0.6 mm

-o                      enable optical_flow

-r                      save the raw data in a .bin file (default is to not save the .bin data)

-s [k]                  enables DEW scatter correction with default of k=0.5, optionally, k can be specified on the command line

-t threshold            voxels with support less than the threshold are not updated (voxels with no support are always set to zero, default is 0.1)

-v                      log VOI activity in recon info file (VOI is hardcoded, so this shouldn't be used)

-x beta_s delta CT_MAP  MAP reconstruction, similar to -b option, but with the smoothing weighted based on the CT map to reduce smoothing across CT boundaries

Changelog
1.0.x       Stable version used for absolute quantification paper

1.1.x       Reenabled logging of VOI counts. Made saving the bin files optional

1.2.x       Changed the handling of the pixel limits in the update step. Cleaned up the code a bit.
            Added support for multiple timeslots and simulation of noise in forward projection

1.3.x       Modified logging of attenuation map creation
            Modified the copy contructor for the Projection class to also copy the data
            Heavily edited the Projection::SaveDICOM() function
            Modified the constructor for the Reconstruction class to pass arrays of file names to load multiple time slots
            Modified the timeslot handling of the Project and Backproject

1.4.x       Rewrote the constructors to avoid code duplication and use LoadBIN to load binary data

1.5.x       Added error checking to the projection loading routines.

1.6.x       Added 4D optical flow code

1.7.x       Modified attenuation correction to only use one attenuation map and scale as necessary

1.9.x       Undid the scale attenuation on the fly stuff, too slow

1.10.x      Rewrote the Project and Backproject function and attenuation map handling to speed up code

2.0.x       Major reorganization of source code


.x is the version of the spect_osem.cpp file

.0      Original stable version

.1      No longer saves .bin files by default, save current reconstruction is controlled by a switch on the command line
        Removed use of MLEM_Norm from recon
        Modified Reconstruction constructor calls to support recon 1.3.x
        Modified the handling of the timeslots

.2      Only saves final reconstruction

.3      Changed attenuation as per version 1.7 of the recon4d code
