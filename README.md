#spect-recon

Software to reconstruct SPECT images from projection data acquired with the nanoSPECT/CT scanner (Bioscan).

The system matrix must be generated first using the create-sysmat utility. By default, the reconstruction code searches for the system matrix in C:\SPECT\system_matrix (Windows) or ~/SPECT/system_matrix (*nix).

Any questions regarding the use of this software can be directed to:
